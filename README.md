# Video Player Dashboard 

React based application to train on React.

Build a simple video browsing interface with:

## Core features:

- A grid of video cards (mock data is fine)
- Each card shows: thumbnail, title, duration, view count
- Click a card to open a modal/expanded view with a larger player area
- Add a search/filter bar to filter videos by title

## Bonus additions if you have time:

- Add a "Recently Watched" section using `localStorage`
- Implement a simple "like" button with local state
- Add categories/tags filtering

## Mock data structure:

```javascript
const videos = [
  { id: 1, title: "...", thumbnail: "...", duration: "5:32", views: 1200, category: "Tech" }
]
```
